WE have initiated a project to leverage machine learning techniques for clustering shooting incidents in New York City. The primary goal is to develop a machine learning model that can cluster these incidents based on various attributes, including location, time, and demographic information of perpetrators and victims. By identifying distinct patterns and trends, law enforcement agencies can develop targeted strategies to prevent future occurrences and enhance public safety.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f43ef84-c58c-4637-90a9-b8aba884c700)
